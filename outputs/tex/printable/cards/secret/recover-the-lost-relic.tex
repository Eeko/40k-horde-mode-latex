Reveal this objective in your shooting phase and select one of your units within 6” of the center of the battlefield that is not Battle-shocked and eligible to shoot. Until the end of turn that unit is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge. This objective is completed at the end of your next Command Phase if the chosen unit is still within 6” of the center of the battlefield. You must still survive until the end of the game to complete this objective.
